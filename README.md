# About
ChatTriggers tutorials is a way for us to create and share video and text tutorials all in one place all while keeping the process open source and public. We will try our best to keep everything organized and easy to find on here and have a seperate part of the ChatTriggers website for getting the links off of this page to share and make them more accessable.

# Contributing
This section will become a lot more structured and strict as we figure things out.

- Select the appropriate folder for your tutorial
- Create a folder with your username
- Create another folder with the tutorial name (its useful to number the tutorials if they are part of a series)
- Create a README.md file

# Restrictions
## Video Tutorials
- The video should have a clear (not clickbait) thumbnail
- README.md should follow this basic outline
```

# Description
A short description
```

## Text Tutorials
- Use markdown to make everything look nice
- Make sure images are cropped and easy to understand
- Avoid linking to outside sources other than the docs or slate
- When a link is neccissary, it should be made to look nice with markdown
```[link description](link)```

# Final Thoughts
Ultimately it is up to us if a tutorial reaches our standards. We can and will reject pull requests for the following reasons:
- If it is obvious that you put little time or effort into the tutorial 
- If it is not your own tutorial
- If the tutorial is vague, hard to follow, or misleading

If we make changes to ChatTriggers that make a tutorial out of date, we will add a note at the top of the README.md and eventually remove it if it does not get updated.
